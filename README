go-bloom is a collection of bloom filters for Go, including a standard bloom
filter, a counting bloom filter, and a layered bloom filter (for counting
occurrences of the same item.)

All of the bloom filters use the 64-bit FNV-1a hash function.

== Installation

go get github.com/pmylund/go-bloom

== Usage

import "github.com/pmylund/go-bloom"

// Normal bloom filter

// Create a bloom filter which will contain an expected 100,000 items, and which
// allows a false positive rate of 1%.
f := bloom.New(100000, 0.01)

// Add an item to the filter
f.Add([]byte("foo"))

// Check if an item has been added to the filter (if true, subject to the
// false positive chance; if false, then the item definitely has not been
// added to the filter.
f.Test([]byte("foo"))


// Counting bloom filter

// Create a counting bloom filter which will contain an expected 100,000 items,
// and which allows a false positive rate of 1%.
f := bloom.NewCounting(100000, 0.01)

// Add an item to the counting filter
f.Add([]byte("foo"))

// Remove an item from the counting filter
f.Remove([]byte("foo"))


// Layered bloom filter

// Create a layered bloom filter which will contain 3 layers of 100,000 items,
// and which allows a false positive rate of 1%.
f := bloom.NewLayered(3, 100000, 0.01)

// Add an item to the layered filter
f.Add([]byte("foo"))

// Add an item to the layered filter again
f.Add([]byte("foo"))

// Find the index of the deepest layer an item was added to, e.g. 1 for the
// second layer.
layer, found := f.Test([]byte("foo")
layer == 1

To use go-bloom in multiple goroutines, use a sync.RWMutex, and surround test
calls with RLock()/RUnlock(), and set calls with Lock()/()Unlock.


go-bloom is based on bloom by William Fitzgerald.
